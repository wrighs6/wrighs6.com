      Welcome to my website!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm Stephen, a student pursuing a degree in Information Technology and Web Science with a focus on cybersecurity.
      Alongside my academic endeavors, I work as a Salesforce administrator developing business automations with Flow Builder.

    <p>
      This website will serve as my personal portfolio, showcasing my web development skills as well as any other projects I've undertaken.

    <p>
      I've been leading a team of 4 other students in developing SomeTrails, an innovative online platform designed to offer a comprehensive database of hiking trails.
      It's still rather early in development, but you can check it out at the link above.
